# MockK Guidebook

A guide to using the [MockK testing library](https://mockk.io/).

- Pages that are ~~crossed out~~ are not yet written.
- Other pages are in progress.

This resource is designed to help you learn how to use MockK, whether you're new to mocking or [transitioning from another framework](./docs/mockito-migrate/_index.md). You can skim and skip around different pages. It's a living document, so it will be receiving updates to add more information over time.
