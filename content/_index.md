<img alt="" src="cover/mockk-bike-iso-transparent.svg" width="640" height="320">

The upcoming all-in-one guide for the Kotlin mocking library [MockK](https://mockk.io/) in your tests.

- Pages that are ~~crossed out~~ are not yet written.
- Other pages are in progress.

This resource is designed to help you learn how to use MockK, whether you're new to mocking or [transitioning from another framework](./docs/mockito-migrate/_index.md). You can skim and skip around different pages. It's a living document, so it will be receiving updates to add more information over time.

Get started by learning about [mocking](./docs/mocking/_index.md)!
