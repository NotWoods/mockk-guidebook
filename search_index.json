MockK can handle mocking Context, static functions, and more to help you test your Android code.\nTo install MockK, all you need to do is add it as a dependency in your module's Gradle file. In most Android Studio projects, this file is located at app/build.gradle. Once you open the file, search for the dependencies block and add a new line.\ndependencies {\n  ...\n  testImplementation \"io.mockk:mockk:$mockk_version\"\n}\n\n$mockk_version should be replaced with the version of MockK you wish to use. The latest version is listed on the Maven website.\nAfter syncing your project with Gradle files, MockK will be available for use in your unit tests (located in app/src/test). To use MockK in your instrumented tests (located in app/src/androidTest), an additional line is needed in your module's Gradle file.\ndependencies {\n  ...\n  androidTestImplementation \"io.mockk:mockk-android:$mockk_version\"\n}\n\nUnlike unit tests, instrumented tests are run live on an Android device or emulator.\nTODO add differences between versions\n"},"docs/mocking/stubbing.html":{"url":"docs/mocking/stubbing.html","title":"ðŸ”µ Stub out behaviour","keywords":"","body":"Stub out behaviour\nYour Kotlin classes often depends on other objects and functions when running. When you are writing tests for your classes, you only want to test the class itself and not the dependency. MockK helps you create pretend versions of those dependencies instead of using the real versions.\nStubbing allows you to setup canned answers when functions are called. You only need to stub methods that are called by your class, and you can ignore methods that aren't run during your test.\ninterface Navigator {\n  val currentLocation: String\n\n  fun navigateTo(newLocation: String): Unit\n}\n\nHere is an example of how to create a stub of the Navigator interface.\nimport io.mockk.every\nimport io.mockk.mockk\n\nval navigator = mockk()\nevery { navigator.currentLocation } returns \"Home\"\nevery { navigator.navigateTo(\"Park\") } throws IllegalStateException(\"Can't reach the park\")\n\n// prints \"Home\"\nprintln(navigator.currentLocation)\n\n// throws an IllegalStateException\nnavigator.navigateTo(\"Park\")\n\nIn MockK, stubs are created by using the mockk and every functions. mockk creates your pretend object, and every lets you define canned answers for different functions on that pretend object. every starts a stubbing block and uses anonymous functions and infix functions to define the stub.\nInside the stubbing block (between the opening curly bracket { and closing curly bracket }), you write the method you want to provide a canned answer for. { navigator.currentLocation } tells MockK to make a canned answer for the currentLocation getter on the navigator object.\nTo define what happens when the stubbed method is called, an answer function such as returns is used. returns \"Home\" tells MockK to always return the string \"Home\" when the currentLocation getter is called.\nInstead to returning successful values, stubbed methods can throw errors. throws indicates that the following value should be an exception to throw, rather than a value to return. When the stubbed method is called in your tests, it will always throw the given exception instance.\n"},"docs/mocking/verify.html":{"url":"docs/mocking/verify.html","title":"â­• Verify that functions were called","keywords":"","body":"Verify that functions were called\nTODO\n"},"docs/mocking/relax.html":{"url":"docs/mocking/relax.html","title":"ðŸ”µ Automatically stub by relaxing","keywords":"","body":"Automatically stub by relaxing\nIf a method has not been stubbed, MockK will throw an error if it is called.
